The BMI Calculator Python program is a simple yet effective tool that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. It categorizes the BMI into standard health classifications such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese, helping users understand their physical health status. The program uses modular functions to separate the logic for BMI calculation and classification, making the code easy to read and maintain. By prompting the user for their weight, height, and age, the program personalizes the output while maintaining accuracy and clarity. Overall, this code serves as a practical example of user input handling, conditional logic, and basic mathematical computation in Python.
